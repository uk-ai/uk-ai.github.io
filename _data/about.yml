  <h4>UK AI</h4>
  
  <p>The UK AI community connects AI researchers from across the country, our mission is to create a hub where researchers and practitioners can come together, 
  share insights, and build academic relationships. By providing such a platform, we can advance together the use of cutting-edge AI technologies for 
  social good.</p>
  
  <p>The following tenets drive the UK AI community:</p>

  <p><strong>Collaborations are key:</strong> AI research and UK AI will advance more if the different actors work together.</p>

  <p><strong>We care about values:</strong> UK AI encourages transparency, democracy, frankness, integrity, mutual support and understanding.</p>

  <p><strong>No single perspective:</strong> As an interdisciplinary community, we balance the trade-off between technical AI research and AI 
  applications when looking to the future.</p>

  <p><strong>Open-minded scepticism:</strong> We always give new developments a chance while being scientifically critical of their implications.</p>

  <p><strong>Clear public engagement:</strong> Our message to the public should be direct, unambiguous and understandable.</p>
